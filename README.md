# Math-IQ

One can think of this app as a digitized version of math flash cards from elementary. The user can pick to answer either addition, multiplication,
or subtraction question. To avoid a game over, the user must keep answering the math facts correctly. A high scores list is implemented to make this game a bit more competitive.

This app was created by using Kivy, a python framework cross-platform application development.
